      Hello there! I'm Wilson, a coder, tinkerer, and lifelong learner. My fascination with programming began through a less traditional route - Roblox. As a young player, I was captivated by the intricate functionality of the game. My curiosity led me to join various scripting communities where I found myself contributing small chunks of code and learning Lua along the way.

      Excited by the power of code and the revolutionary changes it could bring about, I started to branch out, my curiosity leading me down the diverse avenues of tech. I plunged headfirst into the exploration of diverse technologies, programming languages, and innovative solutions, each more captivating than the last.
