          <h3>
            Hi, I'm Wilson from San Francisco, CA. I'm a electrical engineering
            student at Cal Poly SLO. I also work in the cybersecurity field and
            run a ROBLOX business on the side.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            Over the past four years, I have developed a strong foundation in
            programming, with a particular focus on Python. My interests include
            web scraping, using the requests library, creating discord bots, and
            automating tasks. Additionally, I have experience with other
            programming languages such as C and Matlab.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            On the hardware side, I have been studying circuit components and
            building breadboard circuits as part of my studies. I am also
            familiar with various tools and equipment used in the electrical
            engineering field, including oscilloscopes, multimeters, function
            generators, LTSPICE/PSPICE, and Matlab. I also own a Raspberry Pi 4b
            8GB where I host various scripts.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            In terms of professional aspirations, I am primarily interested in
            electrical engineering internship positions, although I am open to
            opportunities in cybersecurity and IT as well. I believe that my
            programming skills will complement my work as an electrical engineer
            and enable me to approach challenges from a unique perspective.
